# This file is for Style Guidelines

- This project uses Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI for styling. Use DaisyuUI classes for components.

## Use strictly defined classes

- Use the `btn` class for buttons.
- Use the `card` class for card components.
- Use the `input` class for form inputs.
- Use the `select` class for dropdowns.
- Use the `avatar` class for user avatars.

## Button styles

- Use only black, white, and gray colors for buttons.
  - Primary `btn btn-neutral` for main action(new, save, submit).
  - Secondary `btn btn-outline` for secondary actions(cancel, back).
  - Tertiary `btn btn-warning` for warning actions(delete, remove).
